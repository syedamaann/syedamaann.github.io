**My name is Syed Amaan** and I like computers!

Over the last 2 years, I am exploring my interests in various areas of computers and I believe my search to find one core area has left me more curious and interested in diverse areas. Currently, I have developed understanding of how internet works, how computers work, how operating systems work and the overshining algorithms underneath the most amazing things.

Moving ahead, I'm keenly exploring data science, the emerging landscape of web3 driven by blockchain, and possible futures at the intersection of reinforcement learning and high performance computing.

If you are someone who is nerdy and likes long conversations around these subjects, you found your guy!
