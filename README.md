**My name is Syed Amaan** and I like computers!

Over the last 2 years, I am exploring my interests in various areas of computers and I believe my search to find one core area has left me more curious and interested in diverse areas. Currently, I have developed understanding of how internet works, how computers work, how operating systems work and the overshining algorithms underneath the most amazing things. 

Moving ahead, I'm keenly exploring data science, the emerging landscape of web3 driven by blockchain, and possible futures at the intersection of reinforcement learning and high performance computing.

If you are someone who is nerdy and likes long conversations around these subjects, you found your guy!

Today’s blog is about the man, who wasn’t a man! 

Alan Turing, i don’t know if you’ve heard about him or you were under a rock but if you were under a rock then i must tell you that Alan Turing is one of the reasons why you are able to read this blog and the reason why you are able to read anything on a digital screen. 

Last night I’ve watched a film based on Alan’s life and its called Imitation Game. This blog is my flow of thoughts after watching the film. 

This timid little guy in school who has been at the center of harrasment and ridicule has one good friend, Christopher. I can’t say how the history of the world driven by computers would have been if Christopher had not died at a young age of 19. After his death, Alan did not know who to be friends with and talk to and this little smart timid guy devoted himself to what Christopher would have wanted him to do, go on to solve the greatest of the puzzles and be the greatest mathematician of the time. 

Years passed and years passed, Alan worked towards mathematics and solving puzzles. Then came The World War 2 and he got himself at the center of cracking the hardest puzzle of the time - The Enigma Code. During World War 2, the Nazis were using a machine called Enigma that could send and recieve encrypted messages. All sensitive war communications passed through Engima and solving the Enigma puzzle would mean the victory of the free world lead by the Allies. 

Did Alan do it? Broke the code?

Why did I start the blog saying Alan isn’t a man and why did I say he is the reason for you being able to read this blog or anything on a screen? 

Maybe I’ll write about it some other day! 

Thanks, \
Syed Amaan
