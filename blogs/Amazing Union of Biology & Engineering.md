# Amazing Union of Biology & Engineering

"I wish you could have been there when the Humans first created us, they thought it was cool to program biology," said a synthetically developed advanced biological being!

How can biology, something natural, be synthetic? How can something artificial be alive? 

No, let's not talk fiction. In the present world where we clearly separate biology from technology, we hold a future where these lines of separation completely vanish. A future where humans can program cells and write DNA the way that engineers write software for computers.

There is one company that is revolutionizing this new technology (or should we say biotechnology or bio-programming. Let's stick with Genetic Engineering!) and the name of that company is Ginkgo Bioworks - The Organism Company. 

Jason Kelly, the CEO of Ginkgo believes that synthetic biology will transform the manufacture of physical products. What computers did for information, Kelly says, biology will do for the physical world. While the story sounds amazing and the future that this story shows looks unprecedented, how feasible and "real" is this technology?

It is hard. Biology is the most complex. Its complexity far outreaches anything that humans built to date. Ginkgo is leading the way for this technology but in the last 13 years of its existence, it failed to make one economically feasible & useful genetically engineered product. This shows the difficulty of this new paradigm but comparing this time frame with the initial days of Artificial Intelligence in the 1950s, we come to a subtle understanding that the future of genetic Engineering cannot be dismissed. To name one, Bill Gates Investment firm had invested in the company and displays hopes for its future development. 

Okay, if the technology does succeed, what is possible?

One possibility, you've probably already heard of data surveillance, but what if it was biological? Using open-source data on the human microbiome that engage with the ethics of DNA mining. It's not a good possibility. 

Genetic Engineering can help in establishing new networks, building new tools, and even infrastructure. How all of these pieces interact with one another can determine research and development, material specification, manufacturing and distribution.

While this intersection of biology and technology is more often told as an exciting story, it is equally threatening. How will genetic technologies shape the way that we understand ourselves and define our bodies?

As Arthur Clark said, "Any sufficiently advanced technology is like Magic." However, the magic can be potentially devastating. So, the values are so necessary for the visions of the futures that we can have today. Technology will shape that future, but humans make technology. How we decide what that future will be is up to all of us.

Yes, that was it. Its me not over-working and doing just enough to get me into EDC TIET, however this technology or biotechnology is exciting in every sense and that is one reason why they are from Y Combinator. 

Thanks,
